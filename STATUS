delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.20:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1803435
   'svnadmin load' fails with bogus SHA1 collision error.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported issue and will prevent users from loading
     certain dump files.  It might also result in silent data corruption
     due to inconsistent cache contents (no reproduction available ATM).
     The fix itself is low-risk as it conditionally disables caches.

     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
